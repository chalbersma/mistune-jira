# mistune-jira

A Jira Rendering Engine for Mistune. 

[Mistune](https://github.com/lepture/mistune) is awesome. It does an amazing job of parsing
markdown. It has the ability to take those documents and export them in different sytaxes.
This is an attempt to write a parser for 
[Atlassian's Markup Language used in Jira and some other tools](https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=all).

The goal is to be able to have data in markdown and then use that markdown to create a well formatted
ticket in Jira. 

Hopefully Jira will someday fully support markdown and make this project irrelevant.
